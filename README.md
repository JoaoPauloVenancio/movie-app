The MovieApp is an Android app to help people discover the most popular movies. The app's homepage displays a list of popular movies and if the user clicks on one of the movies, it will show more details about the clicked movie.

## Here are the main features of the App:
- Favorite Movies page will let the user scroll through the list of the current most popular movies. Each movie in the list displays a thumbnail, title, popularity score, genres, and the release year.
- The movie details page will display all of the fields mentioned above and also the overview, runtime and a link to the movie homepage.
- Show the movie homepage on a browser when there is a homepage link or hide the "GO TO MOVIE PAGE" Button if there is not.

## Branch Strategy

- dev: continously changing and new features being added;
